# USpace
  USpace will be a new web application to organize the user’s daily life. Comparable applications are complex, time-consuming, and lack desired features. USpace will allow the user to track their tasks and habits.  The distinguishing feature of this application is the ability to log and view data over time. The site will lay out the most important aspects of the user’s day-to-day workflow, allowing for simplistic organization. 

  The current user tracks tasks, meals, water, and appointments manually, resulting in paper waste. USpace will be a streamlined, customized solution to track these things and more. The application will store this data and create meaningful visuals for the user to analyze. Seeing visuals of the user's habits will allow them to make more informed decisions moving forward.
